// abstraction model for github.Timestamp struct
// Timestamp represents a time that can be unmarshalled from a JSON string
// formatted as either an RFC3339 or Unix timestamp. This is necessary for some
// fields since the GitHub API is inconsistent in how it represents times. All
// exported methods of time.Time can be called on Timestamp.
type Timestamp struct {
	time.Time
